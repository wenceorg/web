I currently think and work in the <a href="https://docs.rapids.ai/">RAPIDS</a> team 
at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com">NVIDIA</a>. Previously, I was a lecturer in the 
<a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/computer-science/">Department of Computer Science</a>
at the <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/">University of Durham</a>, a postdoc in 
<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/ammp/">applied mathematics</a> and 
<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing">high performance computing</a> at 
<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>, an applications consultant 
with <a href="https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/">EPCC</a>, and <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1842/4352">a PhD student</a>
in the <a href="https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/icmcs">Institute for Condensend Matter and Complex Systems</a>
at the <a href="https://ww.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>.

Much of my work is in the development of high-performance, high-productivity programming models and
libraries for numerical computing. The 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GfzjtHEAAAAJ&hl=en">written fruits</a> of this labour are
mostly on <a href="http://arxiv.org/a/mitchell_l_1">arXiv</a>, but really 
<a href="https://www.firedrakeproject.org">the software</a> is
<a href="https://petsc.org/release/">the thing</a>.
